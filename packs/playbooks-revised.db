Those were the days, huh.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Transformed|page=1]{The Transformed}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE TRANSFORMED</h2>\n<p>Troubled, titanic, grotesque, lamentable. The Transformed used to be human, without any powers or superhuman elements, until something happened and they were changed, obviously and permanently. They might be a cyborg, or a strange monster, or made of electricity&mdash;just so long as they&rsquo;re strange and inhuman, with no way of hiding it. The Transformed&rsquo;s story is about what you do with your new life and form, and how you react to the way other people treat you now. As the Transformed, lots of people will attempt to shift your Labels, just by how they react to your appearance. You&rsquo;re the quintessential book, and your cover is pretty striking&mdash;other people will judge you by it all the time, whether you like it or not. Your story is about how your actions either change or confirm those opinions. You can prove those people wrong&mdash;or you can prove them right. It&rsquo;s your choice. It&rsquo;s theoretically possible for you to change yourself back over the course of play&mdash;after all, everything and anything is possible within Halcyon City. But keep in mind that doing so will be very difficult&mdash;you have no tools to point out such a path for yourself&mdash;and it requires you to change playbooks, or retire your character at the very least. Your character&rsquo;s arc and struggles aren&rsquo;t really about trying to return to what you were&mdash;they&rsquo;re about trying to deal with what you are now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For Not human enough, what counts as a &ldquo;terrifying way&rdquo; is up to you and the GM, but the GM might push you on it to make sure you&rsquo;re doing something actually terrifying. For Coming for you, if it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious who&rsquo;s to blame for a given condition you mark, don&rsquo;t worry about it and don&rsquo;t bother to keep track&mdash;you&rsquo;ll mark plenty of conditions, so just worry about the times when it&rsquo;s a pretty clear choice. For Be the monster, there might be times when it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that you could frighten or intimidate another individual&mdash;the GM lets you know if that happens. Otherwise, though, the move should trigger whenever you do something outright meant to provoke fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE TRANSFORMED</h2>\n<p>Cyborg, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Mettle, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>\n<p>Beast, X-MEN</p>\n<p>The Hulk, THE INCREDIBLE HULK</p>\n<p>Rockslide, WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-transformed.h9IBPuVesvIFXIiA"},"cf":{"id":"temp_qqxz7xipzd","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Transformed","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"5g9DZCdprofPgw60"}

{"name":"THE NOVA","type":"playbook","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"name":"","description":"<h2>THE NOVA</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re a font of power. Channel it, and you can remake the world into exactly what you want. Unleash it, and you can do miracles. It&rsquo;s wonderful...and terrifying. Lose control for even a second, and other people get hurt.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Nova|page=1]{The Nova}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE NOVA</h2>\n<p>Powerful, unrestrained, vulnerable, destructive. The Nova is power incarnate, capable of affecting the world and changing reality on a level their teammates can&rsquo;t possibly match&mdash;but that power comes with enormous risk, both to the Nova and to the world around them. The Nova&rsquo;s abilities are intentionally some of the most openended of any playbook. They can do nearly anything, though not without difficulty or cost. Chances are, if the Nova wants to do something with their superhuman abilities, there&rsquo;s a way they can twist their abilities to do that thing&mdash;after they unleash their powers, of course. And if they miss when unleashing their powers, the consequences will be much more severe than when the Beacon misses while firing a net arrow. The Nova is particularly focused on each moment, each individual problem immediately at hand. They&rsquo;re so powerful, chances are good that they can at least try to overcome any obstacle with their powers, right then and there. As a result, this isn&rsquo;t a playbook for long-term planning or preparation. You&rsquo;re explosive, a battering ram of power. Don&rsquo;t be too afraid of conditions, because they feed right into your flares, giving you still more power to just make things happen, instantly. But that&rsquo;s your story&mdash;balancing the impossible, trying to keep a rein on your power and guide it in the right direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>When you charge up your powers, the burn you generate lasts until the end of the scene. To charge up your powers, tell the GM what you&rsquo;re actually doing, what that looks like for you. If, through charging up your powers, you wind up marking one condition too many, that still takes you out of the scene, just like normal. When you roll + conditions marked, add the total number of conditions you currently have marked to your roll&mdash;but keep in mind your bonus can&rsquo;t go higher than +4. For Reality storm, if you cause unwanted collateral damage, the GM tells you what it is&mdash;and you can expect not to like it. For Constructs, when you animate a construct independent of yourself, you can give it orders and have it take actions. It will obey you. For the most part, the GM tells you the results of anything it does, but the GM might have you make a move through your construct, if appropriate. Shielding allows you to protect someone in the moment, rolling + Freak to defend. It&rsquo;s transient and immediate. Moat allows you to set up a lasting defense in advance, but it won&rsquo;t necessarily help you right in the moment when your friend is in danger. Moat lasts as long as you focus on it and spend more burn when it gets hit especially hard. Worship allows you to awe an audience in addition to whatever else you do when you unleash. You can unleash your powers specifically to put on the display if you so choose. Move can refer to teleportation, barreling hard in one direction, or anything else that fits your powers. Elemental awareness lets you ask the GM any question you want, but it has to be about the place you&rsquo;re currently in, or elements in the area around you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE NOVA</h2>\n<p>Wiccan, YOUNG AVENGERS</p>\n<p>Miss Martian, YOUNG JUSTICE: INVASION</p>\n<p>Jean Grey, X-MEN</p>\n<p>Nico Minoru, RUNAWAYS</p>\n<p>Zero, GENERATION HOPE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-nova.Np2VNduv6B4pN5aV"},"cf":{"id":"temp_9ol04gj85ng","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Nova","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"BZSgBdbWUetYydrx"}

{"name":"THE LEGACY","type":"playbook","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"name":"","description":"<h2>THE LEGACY</h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;re the latest in a storied heroic lineage, a family that shares a name and a cause. Now, everybody is watching and waiting to see if you&rsquo;ve got what it takes to uphold that tradition. No pressure, right?</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Legacy|page=1]{The Legacy}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE LEGACY</h2>\n<p>Capable, impressive, burdened, famous. The Legacy comes from a long line of superheroes, meaning they have a superheroic family, either biologically related or connected through their shared legacy. Their story is about the support of that family, and the pressure of carrying on the family name. They have many benefits and advantages that the other PCs might not have&mdash;the name of their legacy itself probably carries weight with the city&mdash; but at the same time, the expectations and responsibilities placed on them are even higher. The Legacy has a constant source of support and connection in the other members of their legacy&mdash; returning to those characters on a regular basis is an important part of the Legacy&rsquo;s cycle. If you don&rsquo;t spend time with them, you can expect them to purposefully force their way into your life. The Legacy often inherently pushes into a position of authority on the team&mdash;they&rsquo;re probably from one of the most established traditions of heroism in the city. Run with it! Putting still more responsibility on the Legacy only further highlights your issues&mdash;and gives you even more chances to triumph.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>Words of the past lets you ask members of your legacy for input on a problem. The legacy matters is about taking and giving Influence to members of your legacy, and allowing yourself to be shaped by their words and opinions. Both are great moves to push you toward interacting with your legacy on a regular basis. Never give up, never surrender only triggers when you get hit by someone far stronger than you. Choosing &ldquo;You get an opportunity or opening against your attacker&rdquo; means the GM tells you what opportunity or opening you receive, suited to the situation. Choosing to keep your attacker&rsquo;s attention ensures they won&rsquo;t stop trying to attack you after they notice how hardy you are&mdash;you can continue defending others by sacrificing yourself. Symbol of authority should be aimed pretty specifically when you trigger it. You should be clear about the specific person or group of people you&rsquo;re using it on&mdash;and the GM has final say over whether it makes sense that you&rsquo;re using the move on a larger group. Generally speaking, you can only use Symbol of authority on a group that&rsquo;s unified and not differentiated from each other. The move only triggers when the person you command actually recognizes and understands your authority. If you tell a group of unintelligent robots&mdash;or aliens who&rsquo;ve never heard of your legacy&mdash;that they must stop what they&rsquo;re doing, the move won&rsquo;t trigger. It still triggers on enemies who know of you, but hate your legacy&mdash;they recognize your authority, even if they loathe it and choose to ignore it as much as possible. You also might give them an order that lines up with one of the options on the list&mdash;for instance, ordering them to get out of your way. That&rsquo;s fine, and it still comes down to the GM&rsquo;s choice to say exactly which option they choose. Your legacy move triggers &ldquo;when time passes.&rdquo; When there&rsquo;s a jump cut to a later time, when things have quieted down a bit and given characters the opportunity to react to recent events, this move triggers. Members of your legacy might react to your recent actions without triggering this move&mdash; especially if you take particularly heroic or non-heroic actions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE LEGACY</h2>\n<p>Kid Flash, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Robin (Tim Drake), YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Lightspeed, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>\n<p>Beast Boy, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Green Lantern (any), JUSTICE LEAGUE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-legacy.0DjCIf04QTGMWX6N"},"cf":{"id":"temp_f97knzcs0u","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Legacy","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"GzmQVovEq6X7S0br"}

You know what fighting really is, and you&rsquo;re good at it. Sure&hellip;you&rsquo;ve got a soft side, too. But you only show that to the people you care about most. Everybody else? They can eat your fist.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Bull|page=1]{The Bull}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE BULL</h2>\n<p>Gruff, tough, passionate, big-hearted. The Bull&rsquo;s a heavy hitter with big feelings. They get into a lot of fights, both interpersonal and superheroic, especially thanks to their signature move, The Bull&rsquo;s Heart. A lot of the time, they&rsquo;ll be Angry. They&rsquo;re a big, gruff wrecking ball, and you should have fun smashing them into things. Get into fights, emotional and physical! Be blunt! That&rsquo;s the way of the Bull. Your biggest asset in playing your Bull is your core move, The Bull&rsquo;s Heart. It&rsquo;s your way of signaling to yourself and the whole table that you&rsquo;re interested in scenes with particular characters. Pay attention to it, and try to get those bonuses as much as possible. Every playbook&rsquo;s Moment of Truth matters and may shift the direction of the character, but the Bull&rsquo;s in particular is significant. The Bull was made to be a fighter by someone else, and when you use your Moment of Truth, the story of the Bull&rsquo;s origins becomes way more important. Use your Moment of Truth when you know you want to inject that element of backstory into the game moving forward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>You can change the subjects of The Bull&rsquo;s Heart pretty easily, which lets you make sure it&rsquo;s always pointed at characters you&rsquo;re interested in engaging. Other PCs are usually more interesting sources of drama and conflict than NPCs, but focus on the character relationships you find most interesting. If you aren&rsquo;t spending time pursuing either your rivalry or your love, then you&rsquo;re missing out. Also, keep in mind that your love doesn&rsquo;t have to be a romantic love, and your rival doesn&rsquo;t have to be hated. They absolutely can be if that&rsquo;s what you want! But they don&rsquo;t have to be so extreme. Your rival could be your closest friend whom you&rsquo;re determined to surpass. Your love might be someone who&rsquo;s like your younger sibling, and you keep them safe at all costs. Interpret those terms liberally&mdash;that&rsquo;s why The Bull&rsquo;s Heart roles, like Friend, still make sense. You would comfort or support your rival if they&rsquo;re not just an enemy. For Punch everyone, charging into a fight without hedging your bets means dashing into danger without any thought to your own safety or the safety of others. It needs to be meaningful that you aren&rsquo;t hedging your bets or thinking about what you&rsquo;re doing. Often, that means you aren&rsquo;t participating in the move to generate Team for the fight. There when it matters allows you to appear in a scene you weren&rsquo;t previously in&mdash;just work with the GM to explain how you got there so quickly. It could be anything from you just happening to be in the area to you actively tailing the person you protect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATION FOR THE BULL</h2>\n<p>Ms. America Chavez, YOUNG AVENGERS</p>\n<p>Superboy, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>X-23, X-MEN</p>\n<p>Molly Hayes, RUNAWAYS</p>\n<p>Hazmat, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-bull.nl4Im7KgfatfokcK"},"cf":{"id":"temp_fpww3gg8w7h","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Bull","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"Hst0gPHA8FSA2aCB"}

The Janus is two people in one, and their struggle is about balancing that paradox. You have your regular life and all its responsibilities on one side, and your superheroic life and all its madness on the other. And ultimately, you don&rsquo;t want to give up either one&mdash;but they both pull and pull at you, building up the tension until you feel like you&rsquo;re going to snap. That&rsquo;s okay, though. Your story&rsquo;s all about that tension, and overcoming it, especially thanks to the people around you. Cultivate relationships with NPCs and PCs&mdash;they&rsquo;re all important to your overarching story. Pay close attention to your mask. When do you wear it and when do you take it off? Who knows about your secret identity and who doesn&rsquo;t? For you, more than any other playbook, it matters which overt guise you&rsquo;re in, which mask you&rsquo;re wearing, and which face you&rsquo;re presenting to the outside world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For The Mask, affirming your secret or masked identity means doing something that firmly plants you in that role. Leaving your teammates to go save your sister might affirm you as your secret identity, even while you&rsquo;re still wearing your mask. Doing the opposite, going off to fight the Blue Hydra instead of rescuing your sister from the Centipede, might affirm you in your masked role. Affirming your identity should always be a meaningful choice or action in the fiction, something with ramifications&mdash; good or bad&mdash;moving forward. For Game face, whether or not you made progress towards your goal is ultimately down to the GM&rsquo;s discretion. For I am what you see, you can still reject the Label they try to impose on you&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll probably have to if you don&rsquo;t accept it. For Mild-mannered, if they buy your facade you&rsquo;re in no immediate danger of being found out. If you&rsquo;re still under observation, it means that if you do anything too problematic, you&rsquo;re likely to get into trouble&mdash;they&rsquo;re watching you. If you leave something incriminating, it means that later you can expect someone to put two and two together and come to find you. If you have to make a fool of yourself, you can expect NPCs to use their Influence to affect how you see yourself&mdash;and probably inflict a condition. I&rsquo;ll save you is ultimately a move for making sure the people from your civilian life are safe at critical moments&mdash;though it may come at some cost to you. For Dangerous web, you don&rsquo;t actually have to have put the trap in earlier&mdash; when you trigger the move, it can be the first time that you&rsquo;ve mentioned setting the trap. It has to fit the fiction&mdash;if there&rsquo;s no way you possibly could have left a trap, then you can&rsquo;t trigger the move. For your Secret Identity, the GM tells you what opportunity or advantage you receive on a hit. When you lapse on an obligation, that means you can expect to get trouble from it in the near future.

{"name":"THE DOOMED","type":"playbook","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"name":"","description":"<h2>THE DOOMED</h2>\n<p>Something about your powers dooms you. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time before your doom comes for you. Until then, though...you&rsquo;ve got a nemesis who needs fighting and a world that needs saving. After all, it&rsquo;s better to burn out than fade away&hellip;</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Doomed|page=1]{The Doomed}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE DOOMED</h2>\n<p>Tragic, melodramatic, powerful, driven. The Doomed is a character best served by long-term play, even though their story is about time pressure and not knowing how long they have left. They&rsquo;re the only character who starts with a clear-cut enemy&mdash;their nemesis&mdash;and a dangerous timer on their character&rsquo;s lifespan. They&rsquo;re also the only character that explicitly faces death by the end of their story. As a result, adding a Doomed to your campaign inherently adds a level of drama, gloom, and danger to your game&mdash;death, while not a constant element, is now on the table. If you&rsquo;re playing the Doomed, you may feel a desire to avoid using your doomsigns or to stay away from the triggers that advance your doom track. Don&rsquo;t! Embrace those pieces of your character. Filling your doom track gives you doomsigns; doomsigns give you more power; and that power demands a purpose. By default, you can rely on your nemesis to provide you with a purpose, something to strive against, but you can aim for other things, too. Be ready to pay a lot of costs along the way to accomplishing your goals, whether through your sanctuary or other means.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>When you pick the two triggers that bring your doom closer, pick actions you&rsquo;re interested in undertaking, not things you&rsquo;re interested in avoiding. The GM will help stay alert for when you bring your doom closer, but you&rsquo;re primarily in charge of watching for the triggers&mdash;so make sure you&rsquo;re invested in them. For Infinite Powers, you can use an ability from any playbook&mdash;meaning, one of the abilities listed at the front of each playbook, like acrobatics or telekinesis. This doomsign gives you temporary access to new powers, so you can unleash your powers or directly engage in new ways. For Portal, you can appear in a scene with any one other character you name&mdash;whoever else is there is down to the fiction and the GM&rsquo;s choice. The last doomsign, &ldquo;Your doom arrives; confront it and perish,&rdquo; triggers the end of your Doomed&rsquo;s story. It means that whatever their doom is at that point finally arrives, and they can&rsquo;t overcome it. They&rsquo;re lost to it. The full end may not happen instantaneously, but it should happen by the end of the session (or the next) in which the Doomed marks this final doomsign. Once it&rsquo;s marked, nothing can stop the Doomed from perishing. When you call on the resources of your sanctuary to solve a problem, those resources should dictate the conditions the GM imposes on you. Often, you&rsquo;ll have to add some additional resource to your sanctuary to get the job done. If your sanctuary is intricately tied with your doom, then almost always using it to solve a problem should require you to mark your doom track. When you take the advance &ldquo;Clear a doomsign,&rdquo; you erase one marked doomsign. That means you have to fill your doom track again to retake it. You lose access to one of your powers, but you delay the arrival of your final doom. When you take the advance &ldquo;Confront your doom on your terms; if you survive, change playbooks,&rdquo; it means you&rsquo;re forcing a confrontation with your doom&hellip;but you get to define the terms. You might confront your doom and overcome it purely over the course of play&mdash;in which case, the GM might say it&rsquo;s appropriate that you simply mark off this advance and change playbooks. But if you select this advance, you choose to force the issue. You aren&rsquo;t guaranteed to survive that final confrontation&mdash;only to have a chance at victory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE DOOMED</h2>\n<p>Veil, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>\n<p>Raven, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Rachel Summers, X-MEN</p>\n<p>Monster Girl, INVINCIBLE</p>\n<p>Velocidad, GENERATION HOPE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-doomed.c8shVkY15JCON58m"},"cf":{"id":"temp_qxwy0ingnbn","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Doomed","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"PEWpKw7zNVo5sAkM"}

The Beacon is the most directly mortal and least strange of all the playbooks. They haven&rsquo;t been shaped by anything else&mdash;they could choose to leave this life behind, if they wanted. Which is exactly the point. They&rsquo;re here because they want to be here. They want to do this. And that gives them a purity compared to the other characters. You can expect NPCs to tell you that you don&rsquo;t really belong here. After all, you don&rsquo;t have those extras that most people associate with superheroes. A central conflict for the Beacon is proving yourself and making the case for why you actually belong. Ultimately, your character is all about their drives. Those give you objectives, things to aim towards and try to do, so make sure you pick drives that really interest you. Trying to accomplish your drives might lead you into trouble just as much as it might lead you to triumph, but they&rsquo;ll always push you toward that key conflict&mdash;do you actually deserve to be here? And that&rsquo;s exactly what you want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>No powers and not nearly enough training requires you to pay attention to gear. Most other characters only care about stuff like ray guns and special devices when they&rsquo;re immediately dangerous, but you should be listening for cool stuff you can pick up whenever possible. Assessing the situation and Straight. Up. Creepin&rsquo;. are great ways to flag cool stuff you can use. Pretty much a superhero is your chance to control NPCs&rsquo; first impressions of you. It only triggers when you think the other character is actually important, and it lets you frame how they see you&mdash;though the GM can complicate it on 7-9. Whatever Label you pick is the one they reflect back at you through their Influence. Suck it, Domitian requires you to be dramatically under fire&mdash;that means the odds are against you, or you&rsquo;re up against some terrifying threat. If the situation&rsquo;s well in hand, chances are you&rsquo;re not dramatically under fire. Of course, you&rsquo;re often underpowered compared to your opposition, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to get there. Your drives work almost like an alternate advancement track&mdash;even if you aren&rsquo;t there yet on your normal advances, when they&rsquo;re all gone you have to change playbooks, retire, or become a paragon. If you retire or become a paragon, your character becomes an NPC. If you change playbooks, mark that advance like normal, and switch your character to the new playbook.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATION FOR THE BEACON</h2>\n<p>Kate Bishop, YOUNG AVENGERS and HAWKEYE</p>\n<p>Artemis and Arrowette, YOUNG JUSTICE cartoon and comic (respectively)</p>\n<p>Doug Ramsey, THE NEW MUTANTS</p>\n<p>Kamala Khan, MS.

The Delinquent is the class clown, or the punk with the stash of weed, or the rebel without a cause. They&rsquo;re the spoiler, most often just because they can be more than out of any particular desire. They trick other people, they mess with people, they cause problems. That said, the Delinquent isn&rsquo;t an excuse to just be an annoying jerk. They cause trouble because it&rsquo;s how they get attention, and it&rsquo;s how they deal with problems&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re without deeper feelings or goals that make them more human. The Delinquent veers between being selfish and being a proud member of the team, and their moves point them in that direction. Mary Contrary and I don&rsquo;t care what you think! are both about messing with and ignoring the words of others, especially your teammates, while Troublemaker is about helping your team (albeit in destructive ways), and Team? What team? is about both! The Delinquent bounces back and forth over that line, over and over, so play in that space and have fun with it. Remember always that, ultimately, you&rsquo;re part of this team for a reason&mdash; you wanted to be here&mdash;so simply ditching them all is never an option. (Not least because it means your character would probably retire!)</p>\n<p>The Delinquent works best by sticking close to teammates, one way or another, as much as possible. Whether you&rsquo;re giving them grief, getting to know them better, or even revealing your true self, your story is ultimately about how you relate to your closest compatriots. You&rsquo;re the companion, the helper, the provocateur, and you make other characters&rsquo; lives interesting with your presence. Own it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For Criminal mind, you still get +1 ongoing to act on the answers to those questions, just like for a normal assess the situation move. For Are you watching closely?, you&rsquo;re assumed not to get any of the options that you don&rsquo;t choose. That means if you don&rsquo;t choose &ldquo;You confuse them for some time,&rdquo; then your trick may not last very long. If you don&rsquo;t choose &ldquo;You avoid further entanglement,&rdquo; then you can assume someone&rsquo;s going to check up on you later about that deception.

Your home is an amazing place, full of beauty and wonder. But there&rsquo;s something to them, something special that you&rsquo;re missing back home. Something&hellip;human. So yeah, you&rsquo;ll be hanging around. At least for now.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Outsider|page=1]{The Outsider}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE OUTSIDER</h2>\n<p>Strange, curious, na&iuml;ve, arrogant. The Outsider isn&rsquo;t from here, but that won&rsquo;t stop them from creating a life for themself right here on this planet. At least, for now. But can they find a place here? Will they even want to, once they get to know this world more? Or will they answer that siren call, and go home? When you make an Outsider, feel free to go nuts with your homeland. You might be an alien, absolutely, but you might also be from a parallel world, or from the future, or from a digital realm&mdash; whatever. The key is, wherever you&rsquo;re from, it has to be substantially different from Earth and Halcyon City, to the point that you don&rsquo;t fit in even when you try. A crucial thing to remember while playing the Outsider is that you aren&rsquo;t incompetent&mdash;you understand more than enough to get by in your new home. What you don&rsquo;t understand are the more complicated elements of the world around you. Pick a few key areas of different philosophy and psychology as you play your Outsider. You can add all the weird pieces you want&mdash;&rdquo;My people never let their feet touch the ground, and we can&rsquo;t see the color green, and we hear emotions!&rdquo;&mdash;but focus on important and difficult questions, like your people actively dismissing the idea of incarcerating criminals instead of reforming them or believing that those with great power are required to follow the will of the people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>Belong in two worlds inherently implies that you have some status and power with your people. You also must have some method of contacting your people, whatever that might be for you. The hold you spend on pieces of tech or answers can represent benefits you&rsquo;ve gained over the course of your communication with your people, allowing you to say after the fact that they gave you technology or information during the conversation. Spending a hold to clear a condition through contact with home, however, is only appropriate when you&rsquo;re actually in contact with home. When you create a device with Alien tech, you still need human technology to build on. While whatever you build can do something impossible, it often does a limited version of it&mdash;choosing on a 10+ that the device works exceptionally well ensures that you get everything you wanted, and maybe more. If you take a Kirby-craft, its particulars are largely down to your fictional set up. How big is it? As big as you think makes sense. What does it look like? Whatever makes sense for your people&rsquo;s technology. Its strengths and weaknesses just tell you and the GM the important pieces about what the ship can do and how it can be damaged. If it gets damaged, you have to repair it to use it again. For Alien ways, what counts as an important Earth custom is ultimately up to you and the GM. As a guideline, a custom is important when undermining it has consequences and/or creates friction with those around you. If nobody cares if you undermine that custom, it&rsquo;s probably not all that important. For Not so different after all, remember that you have to actually do whatever options you choose. Make sure you let the other players know how you confess a flaw of your home, mislead them about your home, or describe the glories of your home during the conversation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE OUTSIDER</h2>\n<p>Miss Martian, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Marvel Boy, YOUNG AVENGERS</p>\n<p>Xavin, RUNAWAYS</p>\n<p>Starfire, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Warlock, THE NEW MUTANTS</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-outsider.7N8sxGQbJ9aRtbkZ"},"cf":{"id":"temp_w8u6e2wcle","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Outsider","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"m4yesXEbPV21VqCm"}

The Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is defined by two things: their training and their mentor. A Prot&eacute;g&eacute; has a level of skill and preparation beyond nearly any of the other PCs&mdash;even the Legacy wasn&rsquo;t necessarily as well-trained as the Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The Prot&eacute;g&eacute; might have innate powers, sure, but they were also guided in how to use those abilities and more by their mentor. That also means they&rsquo;re devoted to being a superhero in a way that none of the other PCs may be&mdash;a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; made at the start of play has been training for quite some time to get into this life. That said, the question before a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is always whether this is really what they want&mdash;and, more specifically, if they want to wind up being their mentor. For better or worse, the relationship between you and your mentor is always one wherein your mentor wants you to turn out similarly to them&mdash;maybe not exactly the same, but close. And you have to decide if that&rsquo;s really what you want. Regardless of everything they&rsquo;ve given you, you might not want their life once you understand what it really means. Pay close attention to your choices for which Labels your mentor denies and embodies. In addition to telling you the kind of person your mentor likely is, they tell you the kind of person your mentor wants you to be. Make sure you spend time with your mentor. Return to them. Ask them for help and input. You might butt heads with them, you might resist what they choose for you, but they matter to you, as well. They gave you what you needed to become the person you are today, and your relationship with them is the source of your dramatic arc. They might seek you out, but you should do the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For Been reading the files, you&rsquo;re assumed to be reading or otherwise learning about the superhuman world from your mentor&mdash;in whatever way fits their MO. You only trigger the move, though, the first time you encounter any given important superhuman phenomenon. You can&rsquo;t say you read a file about them during a later encounter. When you tell the team the most important detail you remember, you have a responsibility to stick to whatever fiction is already established about the world and this character&mdash;but otherwise, you can add whatever detail you want. The GM tells you if anything is different, meaning that they&rsquo;ll alert you if things have changed surrounding the detail you provided. The resources that your mentor gives you and the team are things that your mentor has access to and is willing to grant you. Ultimately, you&rsquo;re the arbiter of whether they go to the team, or if you keep them for yourself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATION FOR THE PROT&Eacute;G&Eacute;</h2>\n<p>Robin, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Cyclops, X-MEN</p>\n<p>Batman (Terry McGinnis), BATMAN: BEYOND</p>\n<p>Aqualad, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Wonder Girl, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RZXbWcV7kggw6gJH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.masks-newgeneration-unofficial.the-protege.y41BGqECnlP7EyiK"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2frk86xec0w","path":"Basic Playbooks#/CF_SEP/The Protege","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"nOyCTmgWw2qvyc2W"}
