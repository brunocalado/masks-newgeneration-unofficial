Now, everybody is watching and waiting to see if you&rsquo;ve got what it takes to uphold that tradition. No pressure, right?</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Legacy|page=1]{The Legacy}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE LEGACY</h2>\n<p>Capable, impressive, burdened, famous. The Legacy comes from a long line of superheroes, meaning they have a superheroic family, either biologically related or connected through their shared legacy. Their story is about the support of that family, and the pressure of carrying on the family name. They have many benefits and advantages that the other PCs might not have&mdash;the name of their legacy itself probably carries weight with the city&mdash; but at the same time, the expectations and responsibilities placed on them are even higher. The Legacy has a constant source of support and connection in the other members of their legacy&mdash; returning to those characters on a regular basis is an important part of the Legacy&rsquo;s cycle. If you don&rsquo;t spend time with them, you can expect them to purposefully force their way into your life. The Legacy often inherently pushes into a position of authority on the team&mdash;they&rsquo;re probably from one of the most established traditions of heroism in the city. Run with it! Putting still more responsibility on the Legacy only further highlights your issues&mdash;and gives you even more chances to triumph.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>Words of the past lets you ask members of your legacy for input on a problem. The legacy matters is about taking and giving Influence to members of your legacy, and allowing yourself to be shaped by their words and opinions. Both are great moves to push you toward interacting with your legacy on a regular basis. Never give up, never surrender only triggers when you get hit by someone far stronger than you. Choosing &ldquo;You get an opportunity or opening against your attacker&rdquo; means the GM tells you what opportunity or opening you receive, suited to the situation. Choosing to keep your attacker&rsquo;s attention ensures they won&rsquo;t stop trying to attack you after they notice how hardy you are&mdash;you can continue defending others by sacrificing yourself. Symbol of authority should be aimed pretty specifically when you trigger it. You should be clear about the specific person or group of people you&rsquo;re using it on&mdash;and the GM has final say over whether it makes sense that you&rsquo;re using the move on a larger group. Generally speaking, you can only use Symbol of authority on a group that&rsquo;s unified and not differentiated from each other. The move only triggers when the person you command actually recognizes and understands your authority. If you tell a group of unintelligent robots&mdash;or aliens who&rsquo;ve never heard of your legacy&mdash;that they must stop what they&rsquo;re doing, the move won&rsquo;t trigger. It still triggers on enemies who know of you, but hate your legacy&mdash;they recognize your authority, even if they loathe it and choose to ignore it as much as possible. You also might give them an order that lines up with one of the options on the list&mdash;for instance, ordering them to get out of your way. That&rsquo;s fine, and it still comes down to the GM&rsquo;s choice to say exactly which option they choose. Your legacy move triggers &ldquo;when time passes.&rdquo; When there&rsquo;s a jump cut to a later time, when things have quieted down a bit and given characters the opportunity to react to recent events, this move triggers. Members of your legacy might react to your recent actions without triggering this move&mdash; especially if you take particularly heroic or non-heroic actions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE LEGACY</h2>\n<p>Kid Flash, YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Robin (Tim Drake), YOUNG JUSTICE</p>\n<p>Lightspeed, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>\n<p>Beast Boy, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Green Lantern (any), JUSTICE LEAGUE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
