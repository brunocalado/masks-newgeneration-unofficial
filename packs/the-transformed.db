When you didn&rsquo;t feel their stares. When you didn&rsquo;t hear their gasps. When no one thought of you as a monster. Those were the days, huh.</p>\n<p>@PDF[The Transformed|page=1]{The Transformed}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PLAYING THE TRANSFORMED</h2>\n<p>Troubled, titanic, grotesque, lamentable. The Transformed used to be human, without any powers or superhuman elements, until something happened and they were changed, obviously and permanently. They might be a cyborg, or a strange monster, or made of electricity&mdash;just so long as they&rsquo;re strange and inhuman, with no way of hiding it. The Transformed&rsquo;s story is about what you do with your new life and form, and how you react to the way other people treat you now. As the Transformed, lots of people will attempt to shift your Labels, just by how they react to your appearance. You&rsquo;re the quintessential book, and your cover is pretty striking&mdash;other people will judge you by it all the time, whether you like it or not. Your story is about how your actions either change or confirm those opinions. You can prove those people wrong&mdash;or you can prove them right. It&rsquo;s your choice. It&rsquo;s theoretically possible for you to change yourself back over the course of play&mdash;after all, everything and anything is possible within Halcyon City. But keep in mind that doing so will be very difficult&mdash;you have no tools to point out such a path for yourself&mdash;and it requires you to change playbooks, or retire your character at the very least. Your character&rsquo;s arc and struggles aren&rsquo;t really about trying to return to what you were&mdash;they&rsquo;re about trying to deal with what you are now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NOTES ON YOUR MOVES AND EXTRAS</h2>\n<p>For Not human enough, what counts as a &ldquo;terrifying way&rdquo; is up to you and the GM, but the GM might push you on it to make sure you&rsquo;re doing something actually terrifying. For Coming for you, if it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious who&rsquo;s to blame for a given condition you mark, don&rsquo;t worry about it and don&rsquo;t bother to keep track&mdash;you&rsquo;ll mark plenty of conditions, so just worry about the times when it&rsquo;s a pretty clear choice. For Be the monster, there might be times when it doesn&rsquo;t make sense that you could frighten or intimidate another individual&mdash;the GM lets you know if that happens. Otherwise, though, the move should trigger whenever you do something outright meant to provoke fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INSPIRATIONS FOR THE TRANSFORMED</h2>\n<p>Cyborg, TEEN TITANS</p>\n<p>Mettle, AVENGERS ACADEMY</p>\n<p>Beast, X-MEN</p>\n<p>The Hulk, THE INCREDIBLE HULK</p>\n<p>Rockslide, WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN</p>"},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
